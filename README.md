# Fetal Head Circumference Detection

This notebook contains the code for my submision for the HC-18 challenge. 

## Background

During pregnancy, ultrasound imaging is used to measure fetal biometrics. One of these measurements is the fetal head circumference (HC). The HC can be used to estimate the gestational age and monitor growth of the fetus. The HC is measured in a specific cross section of the fetal head, which is called the standard plane. The dataset for this challenge contains a total of 1334 two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound images of the standard plane that can be used to measure the HC. This challenge makes it possible to compare developed algorithms for automated measurement of fetal head circumference in 2D ultrasound images.
